    I'm porting some R code to C++ 11, using Eigen for linear algebra, the GNU
    Scientific Library for special functions and Boost for dynamic bitsets. I
    use CMake for builds. Dr Jacqueline Floyd asked me on Twitter to write
    about translating  the syntax, and I thought I'd write about some of the
    pain points as well. I'm working with numeric code, so my writing will have
    that emphasis.

<p>
	Pain points
    <ul>
        <li>R indexes from 1, C++ indexes from 0
        <li>R does not distinguish between single numbers and vectors
        <li>R's vector expressions don't always have a direct analogue in C++/Eigen
        <li>Expressions in R do not have types
        <li>C++11 will infer that the type of an expression involving an integer literal is an integer
        <li>Always check that the corresponding functions in R and Eigen take parameters in the same order. For instance,
        <li>seq() and LinSpaced() certainly don't.
    </ul>
