<p>
	I'm porting some R code to C++ 11. Dr Jacqueline Floyd asked me on Twitter to write about translating the 
	syntax, and I thought I'd write about some of the pain points as well. I'm working with numeric code, so
	my writing will have that emphasis.
</p>

<p>
	Pain points

	R indexes from 1, C++ indexes from 0
	R does not distinguish between single numbers and vectors
	R's vector expressions don't always have a direct analogue in C++/Eigen
	Expressions in R do not have types
	C++11 will infer that the type of an expression involving an integer literal is an integer
