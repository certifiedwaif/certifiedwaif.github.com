A few years ago, I ordered a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12060">SparkFun Inventor's Kit</a> which had an Arduino Uno in it. And I fell in love with
it, and did all the projects. It was an easy way for a programmer/mathematician like me to learn about
microcontrollers, and it convinced a lot of us that maybe we could do electronics without needing to get an
electrical engineering degree first.

And that was great. I will always have a soft spot for Arduino. It had a large part to do with kicking off the
whole Maker Movement. But over time, as I gained experience and learned more about the field, I started to
become frustrated with Arduino for a few reasons.

<ol>
<li>8 bit, very limited</li>
2 KB of SRAM and 32 KB of flash on the Uno. You really can't do much with that little SRAM. The 
microcontroller's running at 16 MHz. And 8 bit microcontrollers are arguably just obsolete - they're not
even more power efficient.
<li>10 bit A/D, no D/A</li>
My main interest in electronics was originally audio hacking, because I'm an amateur musician. You can't
really do this with Arduino without buying additional hardware. You can do very limited analog output using 
PWM, but that's all.
<li>Expensive</li>
The official <a href="http://core-electronics.com.au/genuino-uno-rev3.html">Uno Rev3</a> boards cost 
AUD$53.66. Of course, you can get clones for much less on EBay, which is
what everyone does. But still, that's a lot for such a limited board. You could buy a Raspberry Pi 3
for about that. And if you buy a clone, you're taking it on faith that it's going to work right.
<li>Arduino/Processing, not C++</li>
Most Arduino programs are written in one file, through the Arduino environment. That's fine if that's your
preferred way of working. But I'm a C++ programmer, and I'd prefer to work with a text editor and Makefiles. 
And I'm never sure exactly what's in the Processing language and what's not.
<li>Very limited debugging</li>
Without buying additional hardware, you're limited to debugging over a serial console with prints.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
I still have affection for AVR. I bought 10 ATTiny85s from China, mostly because they were a buck each and I
could. But I wanted something more powerful. What about the Raspberry Pi or the Beaglebone Black, you might
say? Yes, those are much more powerful. They're single board Linux computers. And they're great for some
things. But one of the things I love so much about Arduino is the simplicity of programming a board without
having an operating system to worry about. For the sort of embedded programming that I'm interested in doing,
Linux gets in the way and adds a lot of unnecessary complexity.

I was looking around the SparkFun site one day, and I came across what was described as the "next step up"
from the SparkFun Inventor's Kit - the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12968">mbed Starter Kit</a>. 
The mbed platform was developed by ARM, and is supported by many partners, not just Atmel. That kit is built 
around the LPC1768, which is a big step up from a Uno (32 bit, 100 MHz ARM, 64 KB of SRAM, 512 KB of Flash,
Ethernet, USB OTG, 12 bit A/D and D/A) with a price to match - AUD$75.36. But importantly, mbed supports a
range of boards, from the very inexpensive and lower specced to the more expensive and very capable like the
LPC1768. mbed addresses all the criticisms I made of Arduino above.

<ol>
<li>32 bit, very powerful boards available</li>
Even the FRDM-KL25Z, one of the cheapest boards in the line, has 16 KB of SRAM and 128 KB of flash, and runs
at 48 MHz. They're just more capable in every way than similiarly priced Arduino boards.
<li>Power efficient</li>
They're ARM - the same CPU that's in your mobile phone and most of your other devices. One of the main reasons
for their dominance in that space is their performance per watt. You can power some of the boards from a coin 
cell battery.
<li>12 bit A/D and D/A</li>
It's not a studio quality audio interface, but it's enough to get going.
<li>From inexpensive and less capable to expensive and more capable</li>
You can buy a FRDM-KL25Z for just over AUD$12. And it's the official mbed-supported board, not a clone.
There's nothing both as tiny and as inexpensive as the ATTiny yet, although I hope the BBC micro:bit might come
close. They weigh 8 grams.
<li>C++, using the mbed platform</li>
Use the GNU toolchain and any C++ IDE that you like. mbed is a proper C++ library for accessing the 
embedded hardware in a platform independent way. Your programs will port to any board in the line that 
supports that feature - just recompile.
<li>Upload programs by copying them to the board/Debug with gdb</li>
The board mounts as a file system over USB, and you just copy the binary over. You don't need to use an
uploading program like avrdude. You don't need a hardware debugger either - debugging is via USB as well.
</ol>

I'm mostly writing this blog post in the hope that other Arduino hackers I've met who became frustrated with
their limitations are aware that there are soime great alternatives available :-) Have fun.
