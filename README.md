Hi Mark,

This page is very simple, the background image is from unsplash so you can use it royalty free without even giving credit (although if you want to be nice, you can).

I'll push some other changes later but this took me about 5 mins to copy and paste from somewhere else and add the image and change some stuff and I'm at work right now so ttyl~~~~

p.s. only noticed this when I did git add, but loooool at all the files for "font awesome", I'm not even sure I used it in the index.html, but you'll want to use it sooner or later. And it's actually quite light.
I recommend just making bullet points of links like my homepage: david-ma.net and leaving that as a very, very simple placeholder :)

I'll write some blogposts about websites and link you later! Ciao!
